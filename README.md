# SlimeRite
 Essentially, it's Slimefun ported to Cuberite.
 Again, This is heavily inspired by Slimefun, thank you TBB!

 Also, this is a hobby hobby project, as in I only really be messing with it if I have nothing to do, including gaming.

Oh yeah, and, while I would not prefer to use sqlite, I realised it's better for save data than json so... yeah

# Notice
Because I am lazy, I'm probably gonna not work on this anymore. I might get back into it if Cuberite becomes an actual viable server option.
